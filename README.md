Environmental scientists urgently need a unified strategy for biodiversity data management as concerns over climate change, land use change, pollution, and natural resource exploitation rise and the global crisis for biodiversity conservation continues.

The Mathematical Sciences Hub (BioMath) in the Mathematical Sciences Department at Stellenbosch University is exploring innovative new ways to synthesise and analyse vast amounts of ecological data to develop a more holistic understanding of our environment. This type of understanding is essential for park managers and scientists to design ways to halt, or ideally even reverse, biodiversity loss.

Together with the NITheCS and South African National Parks (SANParks), BioMath is working towards a future where biodiversity data is more easily accessible by designing user-friendly tools, reproducible workflows and models to consolidate biodiversity data sources and predict future dynamics of biodiversity change.
